# maryland-hero

Maryland Design System heroes sit at the top of every Maryland.gov page, immediately below the header. They carry the page's `<h1>`, optional breadcrumb, description, and primary call-to-action buttons. Heroes are the single biggest visual element on the page and the only place an `<h1>` belongs.

> **There is one hero component — `maryland-hero`. It has multiple variants for different page types (landing, agency landing, basic interior page, news, event, location). Pick the variant that matches the page type rather than mixing hero-style markup from other sources.** The Storybook stories list seven variants; the four most common are documented in depth below (`landing-main`, `landing-agency`, `landing-regular`, `basic`), with shorter notes on `news`, `event`, and `location`.

## What it looks like

Every hero is a `<section>` with `aria-labelledby` pointing at the inner `<h1>` (`maryland-hero__title`). Inside the section, a `maryland-hero__container` wraps the variant-specific content. Heroes never use the standard `block-spacing` rhythm of the rest of the page — they manage their own top/bottom margins.

Two big stylistic families:

- **Dark heroes (`basic`, `news`, `event`):** Maryland blue background (`primary` color, ~#1A4480), white text. Title is Merriweather light at 32px (mobile) / 40px (mobile-lg) / 48px (desktop), 1.4 line-height. A horizontally-flipped Maryland flag illustration sits at the bottom-right of the section at 75% opacity. The hero is constrained to 1288px max-width and sits inset from the page edges by 56px on tablet-lg+.
- **Light heroes (`landing-main`, `landing-agency`, `landing-regular`):** White background, dark text (`base-darkest`, near-black). Title sizes are similar to the dark variants. Light variants use either a full-bleed landscape background image (`landing-main`), a side image with a Maryland blue "diamond pattern" decoration (`landing-agency` / `landing-regular` with image), or a flag illustration on the right side (no-image variants).

Heroes responsively step from single-column at mobile to a two-column 6/6 (or 7/5) grid at `tablet-lg` (880px) when an image or logo is present. The `<h1>` is on the left and the image is on the right; on mobile they stack vertically with the image above the content (except `basic`, which positions the image absolutely so it overlaps the section above on desktop).

## Variants

| Variant | Background | Image support | Buttons | Breadcrumb | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `landing-main` | Full-bleed photo (forest/farmland/bridge) | Required (background) | No | No | Maryland.gov state homepage |
| `agency-home` | Background photo + dark content card | Required (background) | Yes | No | An agency's home page |
| `landing-agency` | White, diamond-pattern accent, or agency-logo accent | Optional (side image) | Yes | No | Agency landing pages below the home |
| `landing-regular` | White, diamond-pattern accent, or flag illustration | Optional (side image) | Yes (toggle via `showButtons`) | Yes | Generic landing pages |
| `basic` | Maryland blue + flag illustration | Optional (side image, protrudes above hero) | No | Yes | Interior content pages |
| `news` | Maryland blue + flag illustration | No | No | Yes | Press releases, news articles |
| `event` | Maryland blue + flag illustration | No | One (right-aligned CTA) | Yes | Event detail pages |
| `location` | Maryland blue + reversed flag, with a white card overlapping below | Yes (inside card) | No | Yes | Office / location detail pages |

## Modifier classes

Many variants pick up additional modifier classes alongside the base variant class:

| Modifier | Applied when | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `has-illustration` | All non-`landing-main` variants | Enables the flag-illustration background layer |
| `has-image` | `image` is set or `heroStyle === "with-image"` | Switches to two-column layout with side image |
| `no-image` | No image present | Single-column layout; for landing variants, swaps in flag illustration on the right |
| `has-logo` | `landing-agency` only, when `showLogo` and `agencyLogo` are set | Adds agency logo to layout |
| `no-description-buttons` | `landing-regular` only, when both are hidden | Reduces vertical height of the hero |
| `maryland-hero--flush` | `basic`, `news`, `location`, `event` | Removes any divider between header and hero so the dark hero sits flush against the header |

## When to use which variant

- **`landing-main`** — Reserved for the Maryland.gov state homepage. Full-width scenic photo, "Welcome to Maryland" title with the "Welcome to" auto-styled as an eyebrow.
- **`agency-home`** — An agency's home page (e.g., Department of Natural Resources home). Dark text card overlays a hero photo with configurable alignment (left/center/right).
- **`landing-agency`** — Top of an agency's secondary landing pages where the agency's logo or a feature image is the focal point. White background.
- **`landing-regular`** — Most other landing pages (sub-section overviews) on Maryland.gov. White background, optional image, optional buttons.
- **`basic`** — Interior content pages — programs, services, FAQs. Blue background. With an image, the image protrudes above the hero by 37px on tablet-lg+.
- **`news`** — Press releases, news articles, public notices. Blue, no image, includes a metadata line with news type and published date below the title.
- **`event`** — Event detail pages. Blue, includes event type + date metadata, a right-aligned CTA button (e.g., "Register today"), and an optional "Past event" yellow tag.
- **`location`** — Office or facility detail pages. The hero itself is a thin blue strip with breadcrumb and screen-reader-only title; a white card with the visible title, image, and address overlaps below.

## Heading level adjustment

`maryland-hero__title` is always `<h1>` and there is **exactly one per page**. If you find yourself wanting a second `<h1>`, you're on the wrong template — use a `<h2>` inside the page body and demote whatever competed with it.

The hero's `<h1>` becomes the implicit landmark name for the `<main>` region via `aria-labelledby`.

## Two pitfalls on the dark-background variants (`--basic`, `--news`, `--event`, `--location`)

### Pitfall 1 — the hero clips without an image-presence modifier

The `--basic` variant has **no `padding-block` of its own**. The vertical padding only applies via one of its layout-modifier siblings:

- `.maryland-hero--basic.has-image` → `padding-block: 3rem` (mobile), `4rem` (larger), with `min-block-size: 21.688rem` on larger viewports.
- `.maryland-hero--basic.no-image` → `padding-block: 3rem` / `3.75rem 3.5rem`.

**If you ship a `--basic` hero with neither modifier**, the hero's bottom border lands at the title's baseline and the title's descenders ("P", "y", "g", "j", "p", "q") clip against the hero edge. The breadcrumb bottom margin keeps the top side looking fine, which makes the bug easy to miss on a cursory scan.

**Always add `.no-image` to an imageless `--basic` / `--news` / `--event` / `--location` hero.** The `.has-illustration` modifier (which turns on the flag illustration) is additive and does *not* substitute for `.no-image`. A `--basic` hero without an image carries both: `maryland-hero maryland-hero--basic maryland-hero--flush has-illustration no-image`.

### Pitfall 2 — `__description` text is unreadable without an override

In MDWDS 0.51.1 the CSS defines a `color` rule on `.maryland-hero__description` for only three scopes:

| Scope | Color |
|---|---|
| (default, unscoped) | `#565c65` (dark gray) |
| `.maryland-hero--agency-home .maryland-hero__description` | `inherit` |
| `.maryland-hero--landing-regular .maryland-hero__description` | `#1b1b1b` |
| `.maryland-hero--landing-agency .maryland-hero__description` | `#1b1b1b` |

The dark-background variants have **no override** — the description falls through to the default dark gray on top of the hero's `#005ea2` blue, where it is effectively invisible. Meanwhile `.maryland-hero--basic .maryland-hero__title` *does* explicitly set `color: #fff`, so this is an upstream MDWDS gap rather than an intentional design.

**Canonical fix — keep `__description`, recolor via `.text-white` on the inner `<p>`.**

Dark variants are visually incomplete without a hero description — the title alone leaves the hero area sparse and breaks the brand pattern used across every Maryland.gov agency hero. Keep the description and override the color with the USWDS `.text-white` utility, placed on the inner `<p>` (not on the parent `<div>`):

```html
<div class="maryland-hero__description">
  <p class="text-white">16,000 acres along 32 miles of the Patapsco River — hiking, camping, fishing, and historic sites just west of Baltimore.</p>
</div>
```

**Why the inner `<p>`, not the `<div>`.** Both `.text-white` and `.maryland-hero__description` have single-class specificity (0,1,0). `.maryland-hero__description` is declared ~368 KB later in `mdwds.min.css` and wins the cascade on the `<div>`. The inner `<p>` doesn't match `.maryland-hero__description`, so a direct `.text-white` rule on it has no competition and the paragraph text becomes white.

**Don't put `.text-white` on the `<div>`** — it silently loses the cascade battle and the text renders in the broken gray.
**Don't reach for `!important`** — the inner-element placement wins cleanly.
**If the MDWDS CSS adds a dark-variant override in a future release** (likely a one-line `.maryland-hero--basic .maryland-hero__description { color: #fff }` plus siblings for `--news` / `--event` / `--location`), remove the `.text-white` utility — the workaround becomes unnecessary.

**Alternative — omit `__description` entirely.** On pages where the hero is intentionally title-only (news-article detail with a dek further down, a location card where the description sits inside the card below the hero), you can drop the `__description` element and let the first paragraph of body prose live in a `<section class="grid-container margin-y-6"><div class="usa-prose"><p class="font-sans-lg">…</p></div></section>` immediately after the hero. With `.no-image` providing padding (Pitfall 1), the title still doesn't clip. Reach for this only when a description-less hero fits the page's content model — the recoloring approach is preferred.

## Breadcrumb inside the hero — follow maryland-breadcrumb.md verbatim

The code examples below show the hero's layout (`maryland-hero__row > maryland-hero__content > maryland-hero__breadcrumb` wrapper). They **do not** show the full breadcrumb markup. The real breadcrumb requires:

- the outer `<div class="maryland-breadcrumb__wrapper maryland-breadcrumb__wrapper--dark">` (or `--light`),
- the dual `class="usa-breadcrumb maryland-breadcrumb maryland-breadcrumb--dark"` on `<nav>`,
- the dual `class="usa-breadcrumb__list maryland-breadcrumb__list"` on `<ol>`,
- the dual `class="usa-breadcrumb__list-item maryland-breadcrumb__list-item"` on each `<li>`,
- the inner `<span>` on each link (the underline-on-hover styling targets `.maryland-breadcrumb__link span`),
- the current-page item as `<li class="... usa-current" aria-current="page">` with a `<span>` (not an `<a>`) inside.

**Copy the breadcrumb markup from `maryland-breadcrumb.md`, then drop it inside `<div class="maryland-hero__breadcrumb">` in the hero.** The dark variant (`maryland-breadcrumb--dark` + `__wrapper--dark`) is the right one for every blue-background hero (`basic`, `news`, `event`, `location`). The light variant is for white-background heroes (`landing-regular`, `landing-agency`).

If you ship the stripped markup shown in the examples below, the breadcrumb renders as unseparated plain gray text on the hero's blue background — items run together with no chevron icon between them. That's what happens when the `usa-breadcrumb__list-item` class is missing (the `::after` chevron pseudo-element is defined on the USWDS class, not the Maryland one).

## Default markup — landing-main (Maryland.gov homepage)

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--landing-main" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__background-image">
    <img src="/img/md-forest.png" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="grid-row">
        <div class="grid-col-12">
          <div class="maryland-hero__content">
            <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">
              <span class="maryland-hero__eyebrow">Welcome to</span>
              <span class="maryland-hero__title-text">Maryland</span>
            </h1>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

In hand-written markup, include both `<span>`s yourself — the inner `maryland-hero__eyebrow` carries the "Welcome to" prefix and `maryland-hero__title-text` carries the main title. Pick the background image to suit the page — the three Maryland-supplied options are `forest`, `farmland`, and `bridge` (Chesapeake Bay Bridge).

## Markup — agency-home (an agency's home page)

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--agency-home" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__background-image">
    <img src="/img/dnr-neighborhood.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__content maryland-hero__content--left">
      <div class="maryland-hero__agency-logo">
        <img src="/img/dnr-logo.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">
        <span class="maryland-hero__title-text">Protecting Maryland's land, water, and wildlife</span>
      </h1>
      <div class="maryland-hero__description">
        <p>The Department of Natural Resources stewards more than 470,000 acres of public land and 17,000 miles of waterways.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="maryland-hero__buttons">
        <a href="/parks" class="usa-button usa-button--big">Find a state park</a>
        <a href="/licenses" class="usa-button usa-button--big usa-button--outline">Get a license</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

`maryland-hero__content--left` / `--center` / `--right` controls horizontal alignment of the content card over the background photo. The content card is `ink` (near-black) on mobile-lg+ and uses `rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.7)` translucent overlay on mobile-lg+; on desktop it's solid `ink` and 845px wide.

## Markup — landing-agency with image (agency landing page)

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--landing-agency has-illustration has-image has-logo" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__row">
      <div class="maryland-hero__content">
        <div class="maryland-hero__agency-logo">
          <img src="/img/mva-logo.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">
          Driver and vehicle services
        </h1>
        <div class="maryland-hero__description">
          <p>Renew your license, register a vehicle, or schedule a road test with the Motor Vehicle Administration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="maryland-hero__buttons">
          <a href="#" class="usa-button usa-button--big">Renew online</a>
          <a href="#" class="usa-button usa-button--big usa-button--outline">Find a branch</a>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="maryland-hero__img-container">
        <figure class="maryland-hero__image">
          <img src="/img/mva-branch.jpg" alt="" />
        </figure>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

The image is **fixed-width** at each breakpoint (198px → 297px → 350px → 400px → 450px → 510px) with a 33:35 (or 17:18) aspect ratio. A Maryland-blue diamond pattern decoration sits at 10% opacity behind and to the right of the image. Logo max-height is 115px.

## Markup — landing-agency, no image, no logo (flag illustration)

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--landing-agency has-illustration no-image" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__content">
      <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">
        Maryland Department of Health
      </h1>
      <div class="maryland-hero__description">
        <p>Protecting and promoting the health and safety of every Marylander.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="maryland-hero__buttons">
        <a href="#" class="usa-button usa-button--big">Find a service</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

A horizontally-flipped Maryland flag illustration appears at the bottom-right at `tablet-lg+` (420–600px tall depending on breakpoint). On mobile it appears as a full-bleed flag strip at the bottom (80px on mobile, 120px on mobile-lg).

## Markup — landing-agency, no image, with logo

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--landing-agency has-illustration no-image has-logo" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__row">
      <div class="maryland-hero__content">
        <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">
          Maryland Department of Transportation
        </h1>
        <div class="maryland-hero__description">
          <p>Connecting Marylanders to the places and people that matter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="maryland-hero__buttons">
          <a href="#" class="usa-button usa-button--big">Plan a trip</a>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="maryland-hero__logo-container">
        <div class="maryland-hero__agency-logo">
          <img src="/img/mdot-logo.png" alt="" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

Logo sits on the right side at `tablet-lg+` with a gradient background; on mobile it stacks above the title.

## Markup — landing-regular with image (generic landing page)

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--landing-regular has-illustration has-image" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__row">
      <div class="maryland-hero__content">
        <div class="maryland-hero__breadcrumb">
          <nav class="maryland-breadcrumb maryland-breadcrumb--light" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
            <ol class="maryland-breadcrumb__list">
              <li class="maryland-breadcrumb__list-item">
                <a class="maryland-breadcrumb__link" href="/">Home</a>
              </li>
              <li class="maryland-breadcrumb__list-item">
                <a class="maryland-breadcrumb__link" aria-current="page" href="/health">Health</a>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </nav>
        </div>
        <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">Public health programs</h1>
        <div class="maryland-hero__description">
          <p>Maryland offers hundreds of public health programs that may be available to you or your family.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="maryland-hero__buttons">
          <a href="#" class="usa-button usa-button--big">Find a program</a>
          <a href="#" class="usa-button usa-button--big usa-button--outline">Eligibility checker</a>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="maryland-hero__img-container">
        <figure class="maryland-hero__image">
          <img src="/img/health-clinic.jpg" alt="" />
        </figure>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

Notice the **breadcrumb sits inside the hero**, before the `<h1>`. It uses the **light** variant of `maryland-breadcrumb` because the hero background is white. The hero has a thin light-gray (`gray-cool-40`) bottom border below the content at `tablet-lg+`.

## Markup — landing-regular, no image, no description/buttons

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--landing-regular has-illustration no-image no-description-buttons" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__content">
      <div class="maryland-hero__breadcrumb">
        <nav class="maryland-breadcrumb maryland-breadcrumb--light" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
          <!-- breadcrumb items -->
        </nav>
      </div>
      <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">Programs</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

Use this minimal form for very simple landing pages where you don't want a description or buttons. The hero is shorter overall.

## Markup — basic with image (interior page)

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--basic maryland-hero--flush has-illustration has-image" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__row">
      <div class="maryland-hero__content">
        <div class="maryland-hero__breadcrumb">
          <nav class="maryland-breadcrumb maryland-breadcrumb--dark" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
            <ol class="maryland-breadcrumb__list">
              <li class="maryland-breadcrumb__list-item">
                <a class="maryland-breadcrumb__link" href="/">Home</a>
              </li>
              <li class="maryland-breadcrumb__list-item">
                <a class="maryland-breadcrumb__link" href="/services">Services</a>
              </li>
              <li class="maryland-breadcrumb__list-item">
                <a class="maryland-breadcrumb__link" aria-current="page" href="/services/fishing-license">Apply for a fishing license</a>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </nav>
        </div>
        <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">Apply for a fishing license</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="maryland-hero__img-container">
        <figure class="maryland-hero__image">
          <img src="/img/fishing.jpg" alt="" />
        </figure>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Important constraint:** `maryland-hero--basic.has-image` positions the image absolutely on `tablet-lg+`, sticking 37px **above** the hero section. The parent of the hero must allow `overflow-y: visible` for this to render correctly — page templates handle this by default; don't wrap the hero in a `overflow: hidden` container.

The breadcrumb uses the **dark** variant because the background is blue. All breadcrumb text and separators are forced to white by the hero's CSS.

## Markup — basic without image

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--basic maryland-hero--flush has-illustration no-image" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__content">
      <div class="maryland-hero__breadcrumb">
        <nav class="maryland-breadcrumb maryland-breadcrumb--dark" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
          <!-- breadcrumb items -->
        </nav>
      </div>
      <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">Apply for a fishing license</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Markup — news

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--news maryland-hero--flush has-illustration no-image" aria-labelledby="hero-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__content">
      <div class="maryland-hero__breadcrumb">
        <nav class="maryland-breadcrumb maryland-breadcrumb--dark" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
          <ol class="maryland-breadcrumb__list">
            <li class="maryland-breadcrumb__list-item"><a class="maryland-breadcrumb__link" href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li class="maryland-breadcrumb__list-item"><a class="maryland-breadcrumb__link" href="/news">News</a></li>
            <li class="maryland-breadcrumb__list-item"><a class="maryland-breadcrumb__link" aria-current="page" href="/news/grants">Governor announces small business grants</a></li>
          </ol>
        </nav>
      </div>
      <h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">Governor announces small business grants</h1>
      <div class="maryland-hero__meta">
        <span class="maryland-hero__news-type">Press release</span>
        <span class="maryland-hero__meta-separator">|</span>
        <span class="maryland-hero__published-date">March 12, 2026</span>
      </div>
      <div class="maryland-hero__description">
        <p>The new initiative will provide grants to small businesses across the state.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

News heroes never support side images. The news type renders in uppercase via CSS.

## Markup — event

```html

```

For past events, add a yellow tag immediately above the title (and you can also use a different label):

```html
<span class="usa-tag usa-tag--warning">Past event</span>
<h1 id="hero-title" class="maryland-hero__title">Bay Restoration Public Meeting</h1>
```

## Markup — location

The location hero renders **two** sibling elements: a thin hero strip with only the breadcrumb and a screen-reader-only title, followed by a white card outside the hero that contains the visible `<h1>`, image, and address.

```html
<section class="maryland-hero maryland-hero--location maryland-hero--flush has-illustration has-image" aria-labelledby="loc-title">
  <div class="maryland-hero__container">
    <div class="maryland-hero__breadcrumb">
      <nav class="maryland-breadcrumb maryland-breadcrumb--dark" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
        <!-- breadcrumb items -->
      </nav>
    </div>
    <span id="loc-title" class="usa-sr-only">Annapolis MVA Branch</span>
  </div>
</section>

    <div class="grid-col-12 desktop:grid-col-8 maryland-hero__grid-content">
      <div class="maryland-hero__location-card">
        <figure class="maryland-hero__image">
          <img src="/img/mva-annapolis.jpg" alt="" />
        </figure>
        <div class="maryland-hero__content">
          <h1 class="maryland-hero__title">Annapolis MVA Branch</h1>
          <address class="maryland-hero__address">
            <ul class="usa-list usa-list--unstyled">
              <li>160 Harry S. Truman Parkway</li>
              <li>Annapolis, MD 21401</li>
            </ul>
          </address>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Note: the visible title on the card is technically a second visual `<h1>`. The hero's `<span class="usa-sr-only">` carries the section's accessible name; the card's `<h1>` is the page's true heading. The address uses an unstyled USWDS list inside an `<address>` element.

## What each class does

| Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| `maryland-hero` | Base hero `<section>`. Provides positioning context, contains background-image and content layers. |
| `maryland-hero--landing-main` | Maryland.gov homepage variant. Fluid height (188px at 320px → 456px at 1400px viewport), full-bleed background photo, white background underneath. Top margin 0 mobile, 24px desktop; bottom margin 32px mobile, 64px desktop. |
| `maryland-hero--agency-home` | Agency homepage variant. Background photo with overlaid content card; content card is `ink` (near-black) background with white text. Padding 64px vertical at mobile-lg, 80px at desktop. |
| `maryland-hero--landing-agency` | Agency landing page variant. White background, dark text, max-width 1288px, top margin 48px at tablet-lg, bottom padding 120px at tablet-lg+. |
| `maryland-hero--landing-regular` | Generic landing page variant. Same dimensions as `landing-agency` but supports breadcrumb. White background, dark text. |
| `maryland-hero--basic` | Interior page variant. Maryland blue (`primary`) background, white text, flag illustration overlay at 75% opacity. Max-width 1288px, 56px horizontal margin at tablet-lg+, 48px top margin. |
| `maryland-hero--news` | News article variant. Same blue background and dimensions as `basic`, but no image support and a metadata line below the title. |
| `maryland-hero--event` | Event detail variant. Blue background, includes a details line and a right-aligned CTA. |
| `maryland-hero--location` | Location detail variant. Blue strip with only breadcrumb + sr-only title; a separate white card renders below the section. |
| `maryland-hero--flush` | Removes the divider between the page header and the hero so the hero sits flush against the header. Applied automatically to `basic`, `news`, `location`, `event`. |
| `has-illustration` | Enables the flag illustration overlay layer on dark variants and the diamond/flag decoration on light variants. |
| `has-image` | Two-column layout: content on the left, image on the right at `tablet-lg+`. On mobile the image stacks above content (except `basic`, which keeps it positioned). |
| `no-image` | Single-column layout, no side image. For light variants, swaps in flag illustration on the right. |
| `has-logo` | `landing-agency` only — enables agency-logo rendering (above title with image; on the right gradient block without image). |
| `no-description-buttons` | `landing-regular` only — removes the hero's min-height so a description-less hero is shorter. |
| `maryland-hero__background-image` | Absolutely-positioned wrapper for the full-bleed background photo. Image covers the full section, `object-fit: cover`, z-index 0. |
| `maryland-hero__container` | Inner wrapper that holds the content and sits above the background (z-index 1+). Becomes a `grid-container` widescreen wrapper for `basic`, `news`, `event`. |
| `maryland-hero__row` | Flex/grid row that creates the two-column layout when an image is present. Column on mobile, row at `tablet-lg`. |
| `maryland-hero__content` | Content column. For `agency-home`, the content card itself. Modifiers `--left`, `--center`, `--right` align content on `agency-home`. |
| `maryland-hero__img-container` | Image column wrapper. Sized to `grid-col(6)` at tablet-lg, `grid-col(5)` at desktop. |
| `maryland-hero__image` | The image `<figure>`. Fixed pixel widths per breakpoint with 33:35 (mobile) → 17:18 (tablet-lg+) aspect ratio. A blue diamond-pattern mask appears as a `::after` decoration behind and to the right. |
| `maryland-hero__logo-container` | Right-side column for the agency logo (landing-agency, no-image, has-logo). Aligned to the right at tablet-lg+. |
| `maryland-hero__agency-logo` | Logo wrapper. Max-height 115px. On `agency-home`, becomes an `ink`-colored rounded badge holding the logo image. |
| `maryland-hero__breadcrumb` | Wrapper for the inline breadcrumb. Adds 32px top padding and 24/32/48px bottom margin at mobile/mobile-lg/tablet-lg. Forces the breadcrumb to take full content width. |
| `maryland-hero__title` | The `<h1>`. Sizes differ by variant; for `landing-main` it's 35px → 55px → 96px; for `basic`/`landing-regular` it's 32px → 40px → 48px. Letter-spacing 0–3px. Font weight 300 (light) on white-backed variants, 400 (normal) on `landing-main`. |
| `maryland-hero__title-text` | Title text span inside the `<h1>` when an eyebrow is present (landing-main only). Renders on its own line. |
| `maryland-hero__eyebrow` | Uppercase prefix above the title (landing-main only — "Welcome to"). 14px (mobile) → 16px → 24px desktop, semibold, letter-spacing 1.28–1.92px, color gray-cool-50 (#71767A). |
| `maryland-hero__description` | Description text. 18px → 24px at mobile-lg+, line-height 1.6, dark text. 32–36px top margin. |
| `maryland-hero__buttons` | Button group. Stacks vertically on mobile, switches to horizontal row at `tablet-lg`. 16px gap. Buttons are full-width on mobile, auto-width at tablet-lg+. |
| `maryland-hero__cta` | Right-aligned CTA wrapper for the event variant. Sits at the bottom-right of the hero. |
| `maryland-hero__meta` | News metadata line (type + date). |
| `maryland-hero__news-type` | News type label. Uppercased via CSS. |
| `maryland-hero__published-date` | Published date label. |
| `maryland-hero__meta-separator` | `|` separator between type and date. |
| `maryland-hero__details` | Event metadata line (event type + date). |
| `maryland-hero__event-type` | Event type label. Uppercased. |
| `maryland-hero__event-date` | Event date / time string. Rendered inside a `<time>` element. |
| `maryland-hero__address` | Location card address block. Maps to `<address>` element. |
| `maryland-hero__location-card` | White card below the location hero that holds the visible title, image, and address. |
| `maryland-location-card-container` | Outer grid container for the location card. `has-image` / `no-image` modifier controls card layout. |
| `maryland-hero__grid-spacer` / `__grid-content` | Grid cells inside the location card container to align it to the page's two-column structure. |

## Common mistakes

1. **Adding a second `<h1>` later in the page** — the hero owns the page's only `<h1>`. Subsequent sections start at `<h2>`.
2. **Placing the breadcrumb outside the hero on landing/basic pages** — the breadcrumb belongs inside `maryland-hero__breadcrumb`, before the title. Mounting it above the hero in `<main>` breaks the dark-background styling override.
3. **Using `maryland-breadcrumb--light` inside a `basic` / `news` / `event` hero** — these heroes are dark; the breadcrumb must be `maryland-breadcrumb--dark`. The reverse is true for `landing-regular` / `landing-agency`.
4. **Wrapping the hero in a `overflow: hidden` container** — the `basic` variant's image sits 37px above the hero on tablet-lg+; clipping breaks this layout.
5. **Adding `block-spacing` to the hero** — heroes manage their own vertical rhythm. The first content section *after* the hero gets `block-spacing` (and its CSS already accounts for `margin-block-start: 0` on the first child).
6. **Putting `maryland-hero--flush` on a `landing-main` or `landing-regular`** — those are white-backed and naturally sit beneath the header; `--flush` is only for the dark variants that need to abut the header.
7. **Editing the description or title color with inline `<style>`** — color is determined by the variant. If text looks wrong, you've picked the wrong variant for the page type.
